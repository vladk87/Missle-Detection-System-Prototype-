# Missle Detection System Prototype



Missile Detection System

Introduction: Developed as a solution for EESC 1011, this project tackles engineering challenge #12: Prevent Nuclear Terror.

Objective: To create a missile detection system utilizing light sensor technology to identify potential missile threats based on thruster emissions.

Design: The system comprises an Arduino board, light sensor, LED, buzzer, OLED display, button, potentiometer, and flashlight for demonstration purposes.

Procedure: The project involved iterative development, starting with obtaining light sensor values and progressing to implementing threat detection algorithms. Challenges included recognizing subtle light changes and controlling the buzzer.

Result: The project successfully created a functioning missile detection system, capable of alerting operators to potential missile threats based on light emissions from thrusters.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates the ability to apply engineering principles and programming skills to solve real-world challenges. It showcases proficiency in hardware integration, problem-solving, and creative thinking.
